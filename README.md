# C-Programming-Training
## [Tutorials Point:] (https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/index.htm "Learn C Programming")
### Reconmended by my line manager
#### Start February 2020

Although most of my software engineering training since September 2019 has been based on frontend development and on various different types of applications, this month I have started my move in to backend software engineering training specialising in **C Programming** as recommended by my line manager.

I am very happy with this *major* change in my software engineering career as during my studies at the Women in Cyber Academy https://www.womenstechjobs.co.uk/women-in-cyber-academy/ (between June - August 2019), I had enjoyed the C Programming module - about 5 days with QA Training https://www.qa.com/learners/become-an-apprentice/cyber-security/ in Bristol. This is one of the challenging and exciting move of my life which I have taken with both hands and I am willing to work extremely hard to make this work for myself and my company who is supporting me through this important development. I believe my move will also help resolve the shortage in software engineers in England and at the sametime this will help to resolve the **diversity and the inclusion** issue in the area of technology, UK.
