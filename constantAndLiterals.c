    Constants and Literals:

    Constants refer to fixed values that the program may not alter during its execution. These fixed values are also called literals.

    Constants can be of any of the basic data types like an integer constant, a floating constant, a character constant, or a string literal. There are enumeration constants as well.

    Constants are treated just like regular variables except that their values cannot be modified after their definition.


 */

/*

    Integer Literals:
    An integer literal can be a decimal, octal, or hexadecimal constant. A prefix specifies the base or radix: 0x or 0X for hexadecimal, 0 for octal, and nothing for decimal.

    An integer literal can also have a suffix that is a combination of U and L, for unsigned and long, respectively. The suffix can be uppercase or lowercase and can be in any order.

    Examples:

*/

212         /* Legal */
215u        /* Legal */
0xFeeL      /* Legal */
078         /* Illegal: 8 is not an octal digit */
032UU       /* Illegal: cannot repeat a suffix */

// Other examples:

85         /* decimal */
0213       /* octal */
0x4b       /* hexadecimal */
30         /* int */
30u        /* unsigned int */
30l        /* long */
30ul       /* unsigned long */

/*

    Floating-point Literals
    A floating-point literal has an integer part, a decimal point, a fractional part, and an exponent part. You can represent floating point literals either in decimal form or 
    exponential form.

    While representing decimal form, you must include the decimal point, the exponent, or both; and while representing exponential form, you must include the integer part,
    the fractional part, or both. The signed exponent is introduced by e or E.

*/

3.14159       /* Legal */
314159E-5L    /* Legal */
510E          /* Illegal: incomplete exponent */
210f          /* Illegal: no decimal or exponent */
.e55          /* Illegal: missing integer or fraction */


/*

    Character Constants
    Character literals are enclosed in single quotes, e.g., 'x' can be stored in a simple variable of char type.

    A character literal can be a plain character (e.g., 'x'), an escape sequence (e.g., '\t'), or a universal character (e.g., '\u02C0').

    There are certain characters in C that represent special meaning when preceded by a backslash for example, newline (\n) or tab (\t).

    example to show a few escape sequence characters:

*/

// input:

Live Demo
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
   printf("Hello\tWorld\n\n");

   return 0;
}

/*

    output:

    $gcc -o main *.c
    $main
    Hello	World

*/

/*

    String Literals
    String literals or constants are enclosed in double quotes "". A string contains characters that are similar to character literals: plain characters, escape sequences, and universal characters.

    You can break a long line into multiple lines using string literals and separating them using white spaces.

    Examples of string literals. All the three forms are identical strings.

*/

"hello, dear"

"hello, \

dear"

"hello, " "d" "ear"


/*

    Defining Constants
    There are two simple ways in C to define constants âˆ’

    Using #define preprocessor.

    Using const keyword.

    The #define Preprocessor
    Given below is the form to use #define preprocessor to define a constant:

*/

#define identifier value

#include <stdio.h>

#define LENGTH 10   
#define WIDTH  5
#define NEWLINE '\n'

int main() {

   int area;  
  
   area = LENGTH * WIDTH;
   printf("value of area : %d", area);
   printf("%c", NEWLINE);

   return 0;
}

/*

    $gcc -o main *.c
    $main
    value of area : 50


*/


/*

    The const Keyword
    You can use const prefix to declare constants with a specific type as follows:

*/

const type variable = value;

// In more detail:

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

   const int  LENGTH = 10;
   const int  WIDTH = 5;
   const char NEWLINE = '\n';
   int area;  
   
   area = LENGTH * WIDTH;
   printf("value of area : %d", area);
   printf("%c", NEWLINE);

   return 0;
}

// output:

$gcc -o main *.c
$main
value of area : 50

// Its good practice to define contants in CAPITALS.
