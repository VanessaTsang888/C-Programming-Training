    Tokens in C:
    A C program consists of various tokens and a token is either a keyword, an identifier, a constant, a string literal, or a symbol. For example, the following C statement consists of five tokens âˆ’

 // 5 tokens:

 printf ("Hello, World! \n");

 /* 
    Semicolons:
    In a C program, the semicolon is a statement terminator. That is, each individual statement must be ended with a semicolon. It indicates the end of one logical entity.

 /* 
    Identifiers:
    A C identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, or any other user-defined item. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z, a to z, or an underscore '_' followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9).
    C does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. C is a case-sensitive programming language. Thus, Manpower and manpower are two different identifiers in C:

    Whitespace in C:

    A line containing only whitespace, possibly with a comment, is known as a blank line, and a C compiler totally ignores it.
    Whitespace is the term used in C to describe blanks, tabs, newline characters and comments. Whitespace separates one part of a statement from another and enables the compiler to identify where one element in a statement, such as int, ends and the next element begins:

*/

int age;

// there must be at least one whitespace character (usually a space) between int and age for the compiler to be able to distinguish them:
fruit = apples + oranges;   // get the total fruit
